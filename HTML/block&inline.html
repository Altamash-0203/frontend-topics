<!-- block elements -->
Block elements occupy the full width of their container, starting on a new line.
ex-
<div>, 
<p>,
<h1> to <h6>, 
 <ul>,
 and <section>.
    

<!--            -->


<!-- inline elements -->
Inline elements do not start on a new line. They only take up as much width as necessary and flow alongside text and other inline elements

ex- 
<span>,
<a>, 
<strong>, 
and <em>.
